/**
 * Class represents an entity linked to a SQL Table of Review documents.
 * <p>
 * The version field is used to implement optimistic locking, allowing Spring Data to verify that updates of an entity in
 * the database do not overwrite a concurrent update. If the value of the version field stored in the database is higher
 * than the value of the version field in an update request, it indicates that the update is performed on stale dataâ€”the
 * information to be updated has been updated by someone else since it was read from the database.
